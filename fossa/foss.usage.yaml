    usage: Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
      Spring is modular, allowing you to use only those parts that you need, without having to bring in the rest.
      You can use the IoC container, with Struts on top, but you can also use only the Hibernate integration code or the JDBC abstraction layer.
      The Spring Framework supports declarative transaction management, remote access to your logic through RMI or web services, and various options for persisting your data.
      It offers a full-featured MVC framework, and enables you to integrate AOP transparently into your software.

    usage: Spring Retry provides an abstraction around retrying failed operations, with an emphasis on declarative control of the process and policy-based behaviour that is easy to extend and customize. For instance, you can configure a plain POJO operation to retry if it fails, based on the type of exception, and with a fixed or exponential backoff.
