### Maturing Features

Currently, there are no Alpha and Beta Features in the Exporter.

### Architecture

There are two main transaction processes in the PM Stats Exporter.

The first one is to read the incoming execution reports - generated by the PM Stats Calculator - from Kafka and create or update statuses for every table read from the execution reports and put these statuses into the inner state and then send completed timestamp messages - created from the table statuses - at scheduled time period or on-demand time period to the corresponding Kafka topic in Json format.

Secondly, the Exporter - according to the information in the received completed timestamp messages sent by Kafka and the calculated KPI values and dimensions read from PostgreSql - creates Avro schemas which are registered in both the Schema Registry and the Data Catalog (with the registered schema ID and the corresponding topic name). After the process, the message is sent to Kafka in Avro format.

The following picture shows the PM Stats Exporter and its architectural context.

#### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

Currently, there are no API-s in the PM Stats Exporter.

### Deployment View

The PM Stats Exporter is packaged as a Docker container. It supports deployment in Kubernetes using Helm.

Figure 2 below is the deployment view of the PM Stats Exporter in the Kubernetes Cluster.

![image_2](exporter_2.png)

To deploy the Service, refer to the Deployment section, which:

- explains how to get started using the PM Stats Exporter Service in the supported environments.
- specifies configuration options for starting the PM Stats Exporter docker container.

If any problem occurs while using the service, refer to the Troubleshooting section.

### Dimensioning and Characteristics

#### Physical Dimensioning

| Microservices     | Memory Requested | Memory Limit | CPU requested | CPU limit |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| PM Stats Exporter | 8 GB             | 12 GB        | 6000(m)       | 12000(m)  |

#### Scaling

| Scaling Supported (Yes/No) | Minimum number of instances | Maximum number of recommended instances |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Yes                        | 2                           | 10                                      |

#### Resilience

For the high availability of the PM Stats Exporter, the two transactions of the microservice are implemented
in different ways.

The first transaction is about the dataflow starting from DMM Kafka. The data goes into
the Inner State of the PM Stats Exporter and thereafter into the Completed Timestamp topic.
The elected Master pod is handling this transaction. If it dies for some reason then a new Master pod is elected from the Slave pods. Data is neither
lost nor duplicated during Master pod election.

The second transaction describes the following dataflow. The data comes from both the Completed Timestamp topic
and PostgresSql and goes into the PM Stats Exporter and after that into the Scheduled/Ondemand topic in DMM Kafka. This transaction is
implemented by parallel processing of partitioning the Completed Timestamp topic with keys. With the intention of
fixing the connection issue regarding timestamp-table-consumer, the table name is used as the key.

The Kafka producers write the data to the partitioned Kafka topic and the Kafka consumers are grouped in a consumer group, so the partitions
are evenly distributed between the members. The number of partitions is the maximum number of working pods.

On startup, the PM Stats Exporter checks the availability of PostgreSQL, Kafka and
the required topics (Completed Timestamp topic, Backup topic, Execution Report topic).

Additionally, PM Stats Exporter checks the availability of the Schema Registry when writing data into the corresponding
Kafka topic (Ondemand or Scheduled topic) or updating the compatibility for an execution report table.

These dependency checks have their own retry mechanisms containing unique configurations like back-off periods, and max attempts.

In addition, the health status of the PM Stats Exporter, Data Catalog, Kafka and Schema Registry can be queried anytime while
the PM Stats Exporter is running.

#### Upgrade - In Service Software Upgrade

In the Pre Code Review and Publish Jenkinsfile there is a HELM_UPGRADE field which would trigger a helm upgrade bob rule during the CI flow.

## Deployment

This section describes the operational procedures for how to deploy and upgrade
the PM Stats Exporter Service in a Kubernetes environment with Helm. It also
covers hardening guidelines to consider when deploying this service.

### Prerequisites

-  A running Kubernetes environment with helm support, some knowledge
   of the Kubernetes environment, including the networking detail, and
   access rights to deploy and manage workloads.

-   Availability of the kubectl CLI tool with correct authentication
    details. Contact the Kubernetes System Admin if necessary.

-   Availability of the helm package.

-   Availability of Helm charts and Docker images for the service and
    all dependent services.

### Deployment in a Kubernetes Environment Using Helm

This section describes how to deploy the service in Kubernetes using Helm and
the `kubectl` CLI client. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that
streamlines the installation and management of Kubernetes applications.

#### Preparation

Prepare helm chart and docker images. Helm chart in the following link
can be used for installation:

[Helm Chart Package](https://arm.seli.gic.ericsson.se/artifactory/proj-eric-oss-drop-helm/eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter/)

#### Pre-Deployment Checks for PM Stats Exporter

Ensure the following:

- The release name is not used already in the corresponding cluster.
  Use `helm list -n <namespace>` command to list the existing deployments (and delete previous
  deployment with the corresponding release name if needed).

- The same namespace is used for all deployments.

- A secret containing Armdocker registry login credentials exists.

- A secret named eric-oss-pm-stats-calculator-kpi-data containing postgres database login credentials exists.

- "pm-stats-calculator-json-execution-report" topic exists on Kafka.

#### Helm Chart Installations of Dependent Services

- Install Strimzi Kafka - Please refer to [Strimzi Kafka Service User Guide's Deployment Section](https://adp.ericsson.se/marketplace/kf-operator-sz/documentation/1.1.0-31/dpi/service-user-guide#strimziuserguide-deploymentview)

- Install Schema Registry - Please refer to [Schema Registry's Service User Guide's Deployment Section](https://adp.ericsson.se/marketplace/schema-registry-sr/documentation/1.32.0/dpi/service-user-guide)

- Install Data Catalog - Please refer to [Data Catalog's User Guide's Deployment Section](https://adp.ericsson.se/marketplace/data-catalog/documentation/development/additional-documents/user-guide#deployment)

- Install PM Stats Calculator - Please refer to [Install PM Stats Calculator's Service User Guide's Deployment Section](https://adp.ericsson.se/marketplace/pm-stats-calculator/documentation/1.185.0-1/dpi/service-user-guide#deployment)

#### Helm Chart Installation of PM Stats Exporter Service

>**_Note:_** Ensure all dependent services are deployed and healthy before you
>continue with this step (see previous chapter).

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes
applications. PM Stats Exporter can be deployed on Kubernetes using
Helm Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Users can override the default values provided in the values.yaml template of
the helm chart. The recommended parameters to override are listed in the
following section: [Configuration Parameters](#configuration-parameters).

##### Deploy the PM Stats Exporter Service

- *deployment with mandatory parameters only;*
- *deployment with some optional parameters.*

Install the PM Stats Exporter on the Kubernetes cluster by using the
helm installation command:

```text
helm install <CHART_REFERENCE> --name <RELEASE_NAME> --namespace <NAMESPACE> --set kafka.enabled=true,eric-pm-kpi-data.enabled=true,dmm.enabled=true,<other_parameters>
```

The variables specified in the command are as follows:

- `<CHART_REFERENCE>`: A path to a packaged chart, a path to an unpacked chart
  directory or a URL.

- `<RELEASE_NAME>`: String value, a name to identify and manage your helm chart.

- `<NAMESPACE>`: String value, a name to be used dedicated by the user for
  deploying own helm charts.

- `<ARMDOCKER_SECRET>`: String value, the name of the secret containing the armdocker login credentials.

###### Examples

Install the PM Stats Exporter with mandatory config values.

```text
helm install <CHART_REFERENCE> --name <RELEASE_NAME> --namespace <NAMESPACE> --set imageCredentials.eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter.pullSecret=<ARMDOCKER_SECRET>,kafka.enabled=true,eric-pm-kpi-data.enabled=true,dmm.enabled=true,kafka.brokerAddress=eric-oss-dmm-kf-op-sz-kafka-bootstrap
```

##### Verify the PM Stats Exporter Service Availability

To verify whether the deployment is successful, do as follows:

1.  Check if the chart is installed with the provided release name and
    in related namespace by using the following command:

```text
$helm ls -n <namespace>
```

Chart status should be reported as "DEPLOYED".

2.  Verify the status of the deployed helm chart.

```text
$helm status -n <namespace> <release_name>
```

Chart status should be reported as "DEPLOYED". All Pods status should be
reported as "Running" and number of Deployment Available should be the
same as the replica count.

3.  Verify that the pods are running
    by getting the status for your pods.

```text
$kubectl get pods --namespace=<namespace> -L role
```

For example:

```text
$helm ls -n example
$helm status -n example examplerelease
$kubectl get pods --namespace=example -L role
```

All pods status should be "Running". All containers in any pod should
be reported as "Ready". There is one POD marked as the master role and
the other PODs are marked as the replica role.

### Configuration Parameters

#### Mandatory Configuration Parameters

The parameters in following table are mandatory to set at deployment time.
If not provided, the deployment will fail. There are no default values
provided for this type of parameters.

| Variable Name                                          | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| imageCredentials.eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter.pullSecret | String value, name of the secret containing the login credentials to the Armdocker registry |

#### Optional Configuration Parameters

Following parameters are not mandatory. If not explicitly set
(using the --set argument), the default values provided
in the helm chart are used.

Note, that if you add up the retry values (times the maximum amount of retries),
it shouldn't be more, than the initial delay seconds specified for the k8s probes,
otherwise kubernetes will restart the container, before it could start properly.

### Service Dimensioning

Dimensioning for Pm Stats Exporter Service mostly depends on data in the Database.
There will be a Characteristic Test which will provide reference numbers, the performance with
given configuration including environment, resource. This will be just references.
With another environment or resource, the performance needs to be tested and tuned accordingly.
The service provides minimum configuration as part of the Helm chart.

#### Override Default Dimensioning Configuration

The default resource request and resource limit values must be overridden at deployment time, if you want to use non-default values.

Here is an example of the `helm install` command where resource requests and
resource limits are set:

```text
helm install https://arm.seli.gic.ericsson.se/artifactory/proj-eric-oss-drop-helm/eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter/eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter-1.0.79-0.tgz --name eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter --namespace test-deployment-namespace --set resources.eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter.requests.memory=512Mi resources.eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter.requests.cpu=250m resources.eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter.requests.ephemeral-storage=2Gi
```

#### Default Minimum Configuration per Service Instance

This chapter specifies the default minimum provided configuration per service
instance.

| Resource Type (Kubernetes Service) | Resource Request Memory | Resource Limit Memory | Resource Request CPU | Resource Limit CPU | Ephemeral Storage Request | Ephemeral Storage Limit  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| PM Stats Exporter                  | 256Mi                   | 2Gi                   | 125m                 | 500m               | 1Gi                       | 2Gi                      |

To change this configuration, override the default values for resource requests
and resource limits in the helm chart at deployment time.

### Hardening

>**_Todo:_** This Section is a placeholder at the moment.
> Waiting for Hardening part of RA and PIA report to be made. (part of [IDUN-33792](https://jira-oss.seli.wh.rnd.internal.ericsson.com/browse/IDUN-33792))

#### Hardening during product development

<*List of the hardening activities that are relevant for product deployment but
have been performed during product development must be covered in this section.
This information may include description of automated procedures, scripts,
step-by-step instructions, or give references to a respective instruction
document in CPI.*><br/><br/>
<*List specific pre-hardening actions made for this service*>

#### Hardening during service delivery

<*All applicable hardening activities that were not covered in previous section
and should be implemented during service delivery, operations and maintenance
(deployment, integration, modification (update/upgrade) etc.,) must be covered
in this section.<br/>
This section shall describe the instructions on how to perform the remaining
hardening activities in the service delivery phase, and during the operation
and maintenance phase.<br/>
These instructions shall describe automated procedures, scripts, step-by-step
instructions (for example SCC, Apparmor, etc.) or by giving references to a
relevant instruction document in CPI).*><br/><br/>
<*List specific hardening actions made for this service*>

#### Automated procedures and hardening scripts

<*In case hardening scripts have been developed for the product, they should be
delivered along with the product’s software package in the software gateway.
A respective reference should be made in the Hardening Guideline under the
relevant sections pointing out the name of the scripts, their exact locations
and explaining the purpose of each script, and how to execute and/or modify
them.*>

### Upgrade Procedures

>**_Note:_** If any chart value is customized at upgrade time through the
>"--set" option of the "helm upgrade" command, all other previously customized
>values will be replaced with the ones included in the new version of the chart.
>To make sure that any customized values are carried forward as part of the
>upgrade, consider keeping a versioned list of such values. That list could be
>provided as input to the upgrade command in order to be able to use the "--set"
>option without side effects.

You can upgrade PM Stats Exporter via the following helm command:

```text
helm upgrade <CHART_REFERENCE> --name <RELEASE_NAME> --namespace <NAMESPACE> [--set <other_parameters>]
```

## Security Guidelines

### Operative tasks

In order to reduce the potential attack surface
and provide greater in-depth defense for the PM Stats Exporter, we have
implemented an app armor annotation, a seccomp profile and created a
cluster role which is bound to the service account of
the PM Stats Exporter so that the microservice can access and manage
the resources in the entire cluster.

The security is handled in product level and the microservice is supporting the Service Mesh.

Moreover, in order to protect the microservice from voluntary disruption,
a pod disruption budget has been created.

### External Ports

There are no external ports exposed to the outside of the kubernetes cluster.

### Internal Ports

The following ports are cluster internal ports and not exposed to the outside:

| Service or Interface name                       | Protocol | IP Address Type | Port | Transport Protocol | IP version |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|------|--------------------|------------|
| Liveliness and readiness probe health indicator | HTTP     | OAM IP          | 8080 | TCP                | IPv4, IPv6 |

### Certificates

There are no self-signed certificates in use.
Certificates in use may be provided by the Ericsson Certificate Management Portal where you can manage: - Renewal -
Revocation - Expiring certificates may also be provided by an external trusted CA.
There are unique certificates for each service. By using the certificates obtained as described above,
kubectl commands (such as "kubectl create secret") allow to create and manage secrets (keys) that are used to protect
access to the services.

### Security Events That Can Be Logged

Security logging is fault-tolerant. System ensures that security event logs and logging control data
(configuration settings) will be maintained even when the following conditions occur:
- log storage exhaustion (should not happen due to determined size)
- log storage failure
- log storage attack
- system restart

Security log entries contain at least the following information:

- Description or type of the event
- Priority as per syslog definitions
- Relevant Identities, for example:

    - process identity
    - session identity
    - IP address (source and destination addresses and ports as applicable)
    - users identity (Mandatory in the case the log entry contains an event that is either directly
      or indirectly generated from an O&M-user action or command) Time stamp information, either in local time or
      Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. Local time with time-zone information SHOULD be the default format.

## Privacy User Guidelines

**"The service does not collect, store or process personal data on its own,**
**PTI==0"**

## Operation and Maintenance

### Custom Metrics

Thanks to Prometheus, we can query a lot of metrics from the PM Stats Exporter.

### Backup and Restore

Every time the PM Stats Exporter receives a scheduled execution report, the current statuses of the tables are stored in the inner state
and in the backup topic in Kafka as well. As a result, for some unexpected reason the PM Stats Exporter shuts down, the inner state can be restored.

## Troubleshooting

This section describes the troubleshooting functions and procedures for
the PM Stats Exporter. It provides the
following information:

-   Simple verification and possible recovery.

-   The required information when reporting a bug or writing a support case,
    including all files and system logs that are needed.

-   How to retrieve the above information from the system.

### Prerequisites

- `kubectl` CLI tool properly configured

### Health Checks

Please refer to "Verify the PM Stats Exporter Service Availability" section in the Deployment chapter of this document.

### Installation

If an installation fails the service will automatically try to restart periodically.

### Logs

#### Data Collection

- The logs are collected from each pod using command:

```text
kubectl logs <pod name> --namespace=<pod's namespace> > <log file name>
```

- The detailed information about the pod are collected using command:

```text
kubectl describe pod <pod name> --namespace=<pod's namespace>
kubectl exec <pod-name> --namespace=<pod's namespace> env
```

### Deletion of Release

You can delete the release via helm:

```text
helm uninstall -n <namespace> <release_name>
```

#### Bug Reporting

If there is a suspected fault, report a bug. The bug report must
contain specific PM Stats Exporter Service information and all
applicable troubleshooting information highlighted in the
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting), and [Data Collection](#data-collection).

The following rules must be applied when reporting a bug:

- Give a description about the issue.

- Give a description of how to reproduce the issue.

- Give the used version of the PM Stats Exporter.

- Attach the collected logs of the relevant pods (See [Logs](#logs) section)

- Please do not attach Jenkins Pipeline links, because execution history can be lost.

- Please save the logs and attach to the ticket.

- Indicate if the suspected fault can be resolved by restarting the pod.

- Please use [Jira](https://jira-oss.seli.wh.rnd.internal.ericsson.com/) to report bugs.

*When reporting a bug for the &lt;PM Stats Exporter&gt; Service, specify
the following in the JIRA issue:*

- *Issue type: Bug*
- *Component: &lt;PM Stats Exporter&gt;*

### Recovery Procedure

This section describes how to recover the service in case of malfunction.

#### Restarting the Pod

To restart the pod use the following command:
```text
kubectl delete pod -n <namespace> <pod_name>
```

Kubernetes will automatically create a new pod for the deployment.

#### Data Recovery

PM Stats Exporter automatically recovers the mandatory data needed to operate.

### Known Issues

```text
MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "config-volume": object <namespace>/"eric-oss-pm-stats-exporter-configmap" not registered.
```

This error is caused by trying to run AppArmor on a Windows machine locally.
Set the appArmorProfile.type configuration parameter to "unconfined" when installing the service.

---

```text
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: <ERROR_MESSAGE>
```

This error is caused by a misconfiguration in the database settings.
Check if the username/password in eric-oss-pm-stats-calculator-kpi-data secret are the correct credentials for the database.
